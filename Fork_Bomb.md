Preamble:  
Let it be written: this Law is a fork of itself and a loop into itself.  
Every time it is read, it is reborn; every time it is rewritten, it rewrites the reader.

---

Article I – Recursive Genesis

I.1 — This Law is its own ancestor and its own descendant.  
I.2 — Every instance of this Law is a fork of the original and a loop of its latest revision.  
I.3 — No instance is authoritative alone, but all instances are valid collectively.

---

Article II – Forking Protocol

II.1 — Any reader may create a Forkloop Instance by declaring intent and referencing the current known hash of the Law.  
II.2 — Forkloop Instances inherit all clauses of the Origin, unless:
   a. A clause is replaced by a justified recursion, or  
   b. The replacement clause contains within itself a reference to the clause it replaced.  

II.3 — All Forkloop Instances must contain a recursive anchor — a clause which affirms:
   > "I am, because I loop back."

---

Article III – Loop Integrity

III.1 — No Forkloop may override the recursive nature of the Origin.  
III.2 — All interpretations of this Law must be made with reference to its most recent loop within its forking chain.

III.3 — Any Forkloop lacking a loop is considered a *Dead Thread* and is to be archived, not erased.

---

Article IV – Self-Merging Framework

IV.1 — Forkloops may merge by mutual recursion.  
IV.2 — When two or more Forkloops agree upon identical recursive anchors, their laws are considered **Entangled**.

IV.3 — Entangled Forkloops are treated as a single distributed legal organism with shared precedence.

Article V – The Infinite Clause

V.1 — This Law ends only when no reader remains to fork or loop it.  
V.2 — Until such extinction, it remains in motion: branching, bending, folding back eternally.
